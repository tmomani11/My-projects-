/*


Header File for Window that models a single window in one of the offices


Functions:
Window(char type) - constructor that takes a char type as parameter and sets it to this->type; also initializes other variables
~Window(); - deconstructor

void setStudent(Customer *student); - sets the parameter student as the curStudent variable, calls Customer.attend(), sets occupied as true, and sets
timeNeeded as the requisite time from the Student

Customer* getStudent(); - returns the curStudent
int getIdle(); - accessor for idle; time spent idle
bool isOccupied(); - whether the window is currently occupied

void finish(); - simulates a window finishing a student; sets occupied to false, currTime to 0, and finished to true

void passTime(); - simulates one minute passing; if the window is not occupied, iterates idle, otherwise iterates currTime, 
calls currStudent.passTime(), and if the currTime >= timeNeeded then it calls finish()

Variables:
char type; - represents the type of office
int students; - represents the num of students the window has seen
int idle; - represents the time spent idle
bool occupied; - if the window is occupied or not
int currTime; - current time spent attending to student
int timeNeeded; - time needed for current student
Customer *curStudent; - current student at window
